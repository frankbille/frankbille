### Hejsa ðŸ‘‹

My name is Frank and I'm a developer from Denmark. "Hejsa" means Hi in Danish.

I have coded since I was 10 years old when I got my first computer (Commodore 64). In the beginning I strugled with the concept of nesting and scopes. These days I'm fascinated by serverless backend architectures, [Flutter][flutter], [Next.js][nextjs] and [GraphQL][graphql].

At my current employer, [Forecast][forecast], we try to create the best [PSA][psa] tool using [AWS][aws], Java, [MySQL][mysql], [React][react], [GraphQL][graphql] and NodeJS. My role as Senior Developer gives me plenty of challenges such as defining and implementing Continious Deployment, Automated Testing, Component Libraries and more...
